## Hello there 🤖

I'm an 🛠 **Industrial Computer Science** 👨‍💻 student at **AGH University of Kracow**, where I explore the intersection of software development, automation, and intelligent systems in industrial applications 🔧.

My main expertise lies in **C** and **C++**, where I work on low-level programming, system optimization, and performance driven applications. However, currently I'm learing about **AI** and how to create **computer vision** models with OpenCV in Python 🐍.
